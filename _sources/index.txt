   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to SCoT's documentation!
================================

This is the documentation of SCoT, the EEG source connectivity toolbox in Python.
SCoT provides functionality for blind source decomposition and connectivity estimation.
Connectivity is estimated from spectral measures (such as :func:`~scot.connectivity.Connectivity.COH`, :func:`~scot.connectivity.Connectivity.PDC`, or :func:`~scot.connectivity.Connectivity.DTF`) relying on vector autoregressive (VAR) models.

Note that the documentation is work-in-progress. Most sections are still missing but we will add them in the near future.
However, the :ref:`api_reference` is in a usable state.
